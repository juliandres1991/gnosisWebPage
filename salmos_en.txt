To analyze Psalm 34, we will use the inductive method, which moves from the general to the particular. First, we look at the macrocosm, the general scope, knowing that this is a psalm of King David that guides us in the search for balance and creation —both in the material and spiritual realms— in order to reach the Being. This psalm leads us toward spiritual triumph. 
The number 34 breaks down into 3 and 4. The number 3 symbolizes triumph through creation, and the number 4 represents the will of the Being. Their sum equals 7, which in the Kabbalah corresponds to the Seventh Major Arcanum, symbolizing triumph through inner effort. 
Therefore, Psalm 34 invites us to attain balance and victory through conscious creation and the will of our Inner Divinity, our Innermost. 
Below, we will explore in depth the meaning of each verse in Psalm 34. 


PSALM 34:1 

“I will bless Jehovah at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.” 

This verse reminds us that we must remain vigilant, acting and living in defense of the energy of the Holy Spirit. We must constantly bless the works of Jehovah, acting consciously to safeguard the Jehovistic forces. 
It is equally vital to avoid verbal fornication, not wasting energy through the word. To speak against the Divine is also a form of blasphemy and a dissipation of sacred force. 
To care for the Jehovistic energies means to be attentive to the three kinds of nourishment: what we eat, what we breathe, and the impressions we receive. We must remain watchful in daily life, avoiding thoughts, emotions, and actions that lead to adverse conditions, for these directly affect our sexual energy. 
At every moment, we must stay alert so as not to lose spiritual merit and thus be able to work properly with the energies of the Holy Spirit. 

PSALM 34:2

“My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah; the meek shall hear thereof and be glad.” 

The number 2, corresponding to this verse, symbolizes the mechanical nature that we must transcend. This verse reminds us that true happiness arises when we preserve the Jehovistic energies and align ourselves with the divine will. 
However, pride is the greatest obstacle that prevents us from approaching the higher parts of our Real Being. 
The meek of heart recognize that true power belongs to God and rejoice in remaining in harmony with Him. Whoever says, “I cannot handle this,” is still attached to the ego, for they have not realized that only God has the strength to overcome any obstacle. 
To master the human machine is only possible as we comprehend humility and cease to act from pride. 
The process of psychological death begins with self-observation. When we act contrary to what the ego dictates, we transform our thoughts and feelings. The ego is sexual energy polarized negatively, and when allowed to act unchecked, it produces explosions of energy that weaken us. 
To avoid this, we must perform inner implosions, conserving and transmuting that energy, just as in the process of cavitation, where light manifests as inner flashes. 
Through self-observation, we place consciousness between the mind and impressions, preventing the ego from consuming our vital energies. Every instant in which we fail to self-observe, the ego wastes the hydrogens necessary for the soul’s growth. If we do not save them, we fall into deficiency, and the soul suffers weakness, emptiness, and anguish. 
In daily life, we must radiate the happiness of living in Christ, accepting Him from within our own reality. The truly meek of heart do not raise their pride against God, but rejoice, kneel before Jehovah, and give thanks for the opportunity to experience the Jehovistic energies. 
They feel blessed not to fall into the seven deadly sins nor rebel against God, but to remain in harmony with His will.
