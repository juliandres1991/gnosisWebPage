## **1. Psalm 34:1**

“I will bless Jehovah at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.”

This verse reminds us that we must remain vigilant, acting and living in defense of the energy of the Holy Spirit. We must constantly bless the works of Jehovah, acting consciously to safeguard the Jehovistic forces.  
It is equally vital to avoid verbal fornication — not wasting energy through the word.  
To speak against the Divine is also a form of blasphemy and dissipation of sacred force.

To care for the Jehovistic energies means to be attentive to the three kinds of nourishment: what we eat, what we breathe, and the impressions we receive.  
We must remain watchful in daily life, avoiding thoughts, emotions, and actions that lead to adverse conditions, for these directly affect our sexual energy.  
At every moment, we must stay alert so as not to lose spiritual merit and thus be able to work properly with the energies of the Holy Spirit.

## **2. Psalm 34:2**

“My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah; the meek shall hear thereof and be glad.”

The number 2 symbolizes the mechanical nature that must be transcended.  
True happiness arises when we preserve Jehovistic energies and align with the divine will.  
Pride is the greatest obstacle to union with the higher aspects of the Real Being.  
The meek of heart recognize that power belongs to God and rejoice in remaining in harmony with Him.

Through self-observation, one interposes consciousness between mind and impressions, preventing the ego from consuming vital energy.  
Those who live meekly radiate the happiness of living in Christ and remain in harmony with His divine will.

## **3. Psalm 34:3**

“O magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt His name together.”

To exalt the Being is to magnify Him within ourselves, dying to the ego and aligning our actions with the Inner Light.

## **4. Psalm 34:4**

“I sought Jehovah, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.”

“They looked unto Him and were radiant, and their faces were not ashamed.”
